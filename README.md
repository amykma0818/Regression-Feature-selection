### Selecting the correct features:
- Reduces overfitting
- Improves accuracy
- Increases interpretability
- Reduces training time

### Feature selection methods
- Filter: Rank features based on statistical performance
- Wrapper: Use an ML method to evaluate performance
- Embedded: Iterative model training to extract features
